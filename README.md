Project 2: Redesign this Website!

I'm pretty happy with the way our project turned out. I find the layout much more convenient and actually used it in place of the original course website when I needed to check dates. I've gotten a lot better at working with CSS, which I used to get the buttons working on the index. I'd still like to get better with javascript and find out why there's a delay when clicking the buttons, but I can see a noticable improvement in the quality of my work so far.
